A lot of my dotfiles are very environment dependent, but these should work independently


## Required software:

- zsh shell
- oh-my-zsh (will run installer if ~/.oh-my-zsh isn't present)
- neovim 0.9+
- Tmux




## Neovim features:
- Lots of rebinds (check out nvim/lua/config/binds.lua)
- NvimTree plugin
- LSP Completion and installation
- Discord Rich Presence when editing
- Treesitter installed (pretty essential)
- NvimTelescope for navigation
- Extra characters to show when a line has trailing whitespace (harder than you'd think the get)
